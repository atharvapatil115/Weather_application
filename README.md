### Weather Application <br><br>

This weather application provides real-time weather information for cities worldwide using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.****

**Functionality**: Users input a city name and click "Search" to retrieve current weather details including temperature, wind speed, and humidity.<br>

**Technologies Used**: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior and API integration.<br>

**API Calling Function**: The JavaScript code utilizes asynchronous functions and `async/await` syntax to interact with the OpenWeather API, demonstrating practical usage of asynchronous programming in web development.<br>

This project serves as a perfect example for understanding and implementing asynchronous JavaScript concepts, particularly `async/await`, in the context of API calls for real-time data retrieval.<br>

Future enhancements may include additional weather details and geolocation functionality. Contributions via pull requests are welcome to enhance this weather application's functionality and features.<br><br><br>

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash <br>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git <br>
Open Weather.html in a web browser.<br>

Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the search bar and click "Search".<br>

The application will display the current temperature in Celsius, wind speed in meters per second, and humidity percentage for the specified city.<br><br>
